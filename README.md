Choreonoid is an open-source, lightweight, and extensible integrated graphical framework for robot development. You can develop your robots with various functions and resources of Choreonoid.

# Functions

## Model Visualization

Choreonoid works as a visualization tool. The provided GUI tools support editing model files, checking self-collisions, and calculating forward/inverse kinematics. Additionally, you can visualize sensor data, including camera images, point clouds, and forces/torques, on Choreonoid.

## Dynamics Simulation

You can simulate the dynamics of robots and environments on Choreonoid. Light-load and accurate simulation environments accelerate your research and development on robot planning and control. Since the default physics engine is robust for contacts, Choreonoid has been utilized in the research on humanoid robots for over a decade.

## Choreographing

Choreonoid provides a function for choreographing robot motions. Visualization tools and dynamics engines strongly support your motion editing. As an example, Choreonoid enabled the HRP-4C humanoid robot to dance with human dancers in 2010. You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcZJqiUrbnI).

## Potential

Choreonoid has been used in various situations. Application examples are shown in the following figures and the fields of application range from research to industry and entertainment. One of the advanced features of Choreonoid is extensibility, so you can easily add your own plugins suitable for your project with plentiful resources provided by both Choreonoid and third parties.

# Installation

To install Choreonoid, please see [the installation page](https://choreonoid.org/en/manuals/latest/install/install.html) on the official document

## Additional notes for this fork

This repository includes the `vnoid` library as a **Git submodule** under `ext/vnoid`.
When cloning this repository, please use the `--recurse-submodules` option:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Mamo1031/choreonoid.git
```

If you have already cloned without it, initialize and update the submodule with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The `vnoid` submodule contains custom robot, controller, and project files used for simulation.
If you modify files in `ext/vnoid`, commit and push changes **inside the submodule** first,  
then update and commit the submodule reference in this parent repository.

## ROS Support

ROS (currently, only ROS1) is supported. Please see [our official document](https://choreonoid.org/en/manuals/latest/ros/index.html) to set up Choreonoid with ROS.

# Development

Choreonoid project is led by [Dr. Shin'ichiro Nakaoka](https://github.com/s-nakaoka). After the start of the project in 2006, Choreonoid had been developed at National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, until 2019. Currently, Choreonoid Inc. maintains this project.
